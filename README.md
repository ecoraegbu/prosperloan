# Diamonds Data Exploration

## Dataset

This data set is a record of loans from Prosper Loan in the United States. It contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan. I would attempt to summarize, in this report, the actions taken to analyze the various relationships (univariate, bivariate, and multivariate) between variables in the dataset. This research was undertaken to provide some insights into the performance of loans and the lending business as it relates to Prosper loans. A presentation of our findings would be made at the end of the analysis. Although the data frame has 81 features, this study is only interested in a few of the features. The data set consists of 113,937 rows and 81 columns, implying 113,937 recorded observations with 81 features. The main features of interest to this study include, but are not limited to the following; loan status, loan term, Employment Status, the borrower's home ownership status, state, verifiable income, and occupation. In total, about 11 features were pulled together over which the bulk of our exploration and analysis were done. Several steps were taken to clean the data further. making it suitable for analysis. these steps included; filling null values, dropping duplicate rows, renaming columns, changing data types, and transforming names.
